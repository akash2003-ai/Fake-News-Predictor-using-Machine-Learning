# 📰 Fake News Predictor using Machine Learning  

## 🔍 Overview  
This project is a **Fake News Detection System** built using **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
It identifies whether a news article is **real or fake** based on its textual content.  

The model is trained using a labeled dataset and performs data preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF), and classification to predict the authenticity of news content.
